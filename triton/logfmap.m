function [M,N,G] = logfmap(I,L,H)
% [M,N] = logfmap(I,L,H)
%     Return a maxtrix for premultiplying spectrograms to map
%     the rows into a log frequency space.
%     Output map covers bins L to H of input
%     L must be larger than 1, since the lowest bin of the FFT
%     (corresponding to 0 Hz) cannot be represented on a 
%     log frequency axis.  Including bins close to 1 makes 
%     the number of output rows exponentially larger.
%     N returns the recovery matrix such that N*M is approximately I
%     (for dimensions L to H).
