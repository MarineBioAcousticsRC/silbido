This project implements a tonal detector designed for dolphin whistles.  It is described in the following publications:

When pulling directly from the repository, Java and Matlab executable files will need to be compiled.  Instructions on doing this are in the documentation directory, but this requires the availability of build tools such as Java and C++ compilers.  If you do not wish to do this, there is a binary build available for Windows systems that can be simply downloaded.  Other operating systems may choose to download the binary as well.  The compiled Java files are system independent, and you will only need to compile the C++ files for the Matlab executables.
