% Viewpath's provide a method for manipulating files across multiple
% directories.  This can be used to keep a directory pristine (e.g. data is
% stored in one directory, meta-data in another), permit multiple users
% to share common resources, etc.
%
% Given a file fname and a list of directories, attempt to open
% the file in one of the directories of viewpath.  fname may
% either contain a name relative to directories of the viewpath
% or may contain a fully qualified name that contains one of the 
% viewpath directories.
% 
% Regardless of whether or not the the name is fully qualified,
% the behavior is as follows:  
%
% For files that are opened only for reading, the viewpath is searched
% until a file is found or the viewpath is exhausted.
% 
% For files that are opened for writing the path is searched for the 
% first existing instance of the file.  If it exists, the
% function attempts to open it.  Otherwise, the file will be opened
% relative to the first directory in the viewpath.  Any needed directories
% will be created.  This occurs even if the open fails.
